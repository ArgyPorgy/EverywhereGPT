Step 1: 

Copy paste your own OpenAI API key in the "content_script.js" file, at key = "";

Step 2:
Open a web browser (preferably Google Chrome or Firefox). Access the browser's extensions or add-ons page. Enable developer mode or a similar option.

Step 3: Load the Extension

Load the EverywhereGPT extension into the web browser. This may involve clicking on buttons like "Load unpacked" or "Add extension."

Step 4: Confirm Extension Installation

Once the extension is added, you may see its icon in the browser's toolbar. This indicates that the extension has been successfully installed.

Step 5: Test the Extension

Navigate to a webpage where you want to use EverywhereGPT.

You should see the extension's icon on the webpage, where you want to use it. Once you write a prompt in the desired textbox, click on the icon closest to the box. You can also move the icon to wherever you wish by using your mouse.


Congratulations! You've successfully set up and run the EverywhereGPT extension on your PC. Enjoy its capabilities to enhance your online interactions.
